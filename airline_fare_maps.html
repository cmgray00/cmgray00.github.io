					<h2>Introduction</h2>
					
					<p>About 2.9M passengers fly in and out of US airports daily (Federal Aviation Administration, 2023).
					To manage such a feat, airports must manage carefully timed schedules, monitor several variables 
					(plane maintenance, weather, and air traffic to name a few), and rapidly determine alternative plans 
					due to poor planning and/or luck. COVID-19 was a particularly difficult time for the flight industry, 
					considering travel bans and extended fear of social gatherings.</p>
					
					<p>We review whether the flight industry has “bounced back” to pre-COVID performance by comparing
					2018 and 2023 average fare data. A network analysis supports investigation of the driving cause(s)
					of fare changes. Marketing carriers glean insights into other carriers’ strategies.</p>

				<div class="content">
					<p>Two data sources were analyzed while two others supported visualization:</p>
					
					<ul><li>Data for analysis, via the Bureau of Transportation Statistics:</li>

							</ul>
					</ul>
					
					<p>Each month of source 1 contained between 600k and 702k flight records, necessitating a
						more targeted analysis. Source 2 was used to do so by exploring the most drastic changes
						in average fares per airport over time.</p>
						
					<p>Source 2 was formatted into quarters. Quarter 3 of 2018 and 2023 were chosen
					to sandwich COVID-19 inside the latest available data. Quarter 3 runs from July 1 
					through September 30. Ultimately, carrier-airport conclusions were confined 
					to September to hasten results from visualization algorithms.</p>

			  <h2 class='mb-3'>Findings, <i>in a nutshell</i></h2>
				<div class="content">
					<p>Exploratory data analysis revealed that, in the sample data overall, each airport's average
					fares in 2023 were cheaper than they were 5 years ago (even after adjusting for inflation):</p>

					<p>Most airports with significant average fare increases (>= $200) were balanced by significant airport
						fare reductions in another part of the state:</p>

					<p>No geographical patterns regarding significant change airports were found, although a "slanted sandwich" 
					pattern appears state-wise (see below.) Passengers should avoid Utah if possible, while Iowa, Colorado,
					Louisiana, Mississippi, and Alabama offer great discounts:</p>

					<p>A budding theory comes to mind when we see Colorado; budget airline Frontier is headquartered there. Are 
					budget airlines shaking things up at each of the signficant fare change airports? The following interactive 
					sankey diagram allows the user to compare marketing carrier distributions for each of those airports:</p>
				
				</div>
				</div> <!-- End narrower alignment -->

				
				<i>Interact with me <b>on a desktop (wide screen)</b> by hovering over text or bars!</i>
				Green airports experienced significantly reduced average airfares, while orange ones exhibited significant increases
				by 2023.
				<div class='container-fluid align-items-center'>
					<iframe src="images/projects/airline_network/sankey2.html" 
					left='100px' width='1500px' height='700px' scrolling='no';></iframe>
				</div>
				<p><i>* Recall per the data source, these marketing carriers have at least 1% revenue. 
				Anyone making less would not appear.</i></p>
				
			<div class='container-md mb-4'>
				<p><b>A few highlights</b> demonstrate how the diagram can be explored for insights:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Contrary to our theory, only 5/21 significant change airports (DBQ, DUT, EAU, HVN, OWB) were explained by
							an unknown smaller airline overtake (having less than 1% revenue).
							<ul><li>See the 2023 pattern of an unknown marketing carrier overtake by hovering over i.e. DBQ.</li></ul>
						<li>These overtakes weren't always reductions. Among the 5, DUT managed to charge significantly more.
							<ul><li>Notice that DUT is colored orange - meaning a significant increase in 2023 relative to 2018.</li></ul>
						<li>Significant fare increases are more common when there's a marketing airline monopoly.
							<ul><li>Seen by comparing the proportion of all single-ribbon (monopoly) fare changes in 2023 that
							are colored orange (increases; 2/8 as PRC and SPN) versus the proportion of multi-ribbon fare changes 
							in 2023 that are colored orange (0/7).</li></ul>
						<li>New Southwest Airlines competition was responsible for the CO-based savings. 
							<ul><li>Seen by hovering over each CO airport. Alternatively, hovering over Southwest Airlines Co. shows their 
							0% to 2.6% flight prevalence among the significant change airports, with equal flight frequencies for 
							the two	locations.</li></ul>
						<li>Alaska Airlines and Allegiant Air are moving away from these highly
							competitive airports.
							<ul><li>Seen by comparing the marketing carrier percentages across years without 
							hovering over any content. Alaska Airlines has gone from 2.9% to 0.4% of flights here.</li></ul>
					</ul>
				
				<p><b>Some strong limitations exist:</b></p>
				<ul>
					<li>We don't know <b>anything</b> about the data sampling methodology pertaining to fares paid. 
						Insights related to fares should therefore be taken with a grain of salt.</li>
					<li>Even if data sampling was representative, the short timeframe findings may not apply to a full year.</li>
					<li>Fares discussed are only "base" fares, but "base" is not the same for everyone. For instance, Frontier's
						base fare lacks an overhead carry-on bag, while (at the time of writing) American Airlines built this
						expense into their base. Comparing fares is thus compromised, and we cannot answer definitively whether
						airlines have fully recovered from COVID-19.</li>
				</ul>
				
				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>The sankey diagram is suited for users who wish to explore and dig manually - as specialists in their field.
				Some search themes would likely emerge for those specialists.
				For an enhanced user experience, <b>the next phase</b> would demonstrate thematic insights with less effort. 
				A dashboard would feature a more traditional network diagram above the sankey, and be based on the existing map 
				(where nodes represent airports, positioned at their geographical coordinates.)
				New lines connect the airports that have flights between them (called "edges.")
				
				<ul><li>Clicking on a Marketing Airline (American Airlines, etc...) filter would reveal their network coverage.</li>
					<li>Clicking on an airport would emphasize just that airport's connections.</li>
					<li>Each edge could be colored by the Marketing Airline or by dynamic value thresholds (read onward.)</li>
					<li>Sizing edges by different features would be appealing to different audiences and questions. This is especially
						valuable to compare the competition.</li>
					<ul><li>If sizing by average fare, passengers could see the cheapest destinations and airlines out of their local airport.</li>
						<li>If sizing by average fare per mile, both airlines and passengers can assess "fare fairness."</li>
						<li>If sizing by average delay, both airlines and passengers once again compare the competition and consider 
						where to make upgrades or which alternative carrier could offer the smoothest travel plan.</li>
					</ul>
				</ul></p>
				
				<p><b>Creative challenges exist for this phase:</b>
				<ul><li>Edges aren't always drawn in the aesthetically preferred direction (across v. around the globe),
						although solutions exist</li>
					<li>Segmenting an edge into categories isn't something I've seen before, but I have some ideas...</li>
				</ul></p>
				
				<p><b>Keeping an open mind</b> and <b>being playful with constructive criticism</b> led to further 
				experimentation	and more intimate knowledge about tweaking parameters in graphing libraries. My preferences
				for specific libraries based on graph type became more complex.</p>
				
				<p>Our class didn't know R could produce interactive visuals. In light of relatively sparse change requests and
				an abundance of questions about how I made the map, I created a tutorial.</p>
